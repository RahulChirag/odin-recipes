            <p>This method mimics the traditional time-consuming method of making cold-brew coffee in the fridge, but in
                2
                hours
                instead of 24! The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not
                hot
                enough to release the bitter, acidic flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee. The result is a super
                smooth
                brew that you'll want to make again and again. Use your favorite fresh-ground coffee for best results.

        <div class="content_ing">
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup coarsely ground coffee</li>
                <li>4 (16-ounce) Mason jars</li>
                <li>8 cups water</li>
            </ul>

        <h1 class="steps_ing">Steps</h1>
        <div class="content_steps">
            <ol>
                <li>Step - 1: <p>Place 1/4 cup coffee grounds into each jar, then top with water. Screw on the lids
                        until
                        just
                        barely tightened; do not overtighten.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step - 2: <p>Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the jars completely and place a sous vide
                        immersion
                        cooker into the water. Set temperature to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) according to
                        manufacturer's
                        directions.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step - 3: <p>Submerge mason jars into the water bath and set timer for 2 hours.</p>
                </li>
                <li>Step - 4: <p>Remove jars to a cooling rack and let cool until easily handled. Strain the mixture
                        through
                        a
                        coffee filter to stop the steeping process. Pour over ice and serve, or return to rinsed-out
                        jars
                        and
                        store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
