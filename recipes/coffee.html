    <h1>Sous Vide "Cold Brew" Coffee</h1>
    <h1>Description</h1>
    <img src="../_Assets/coffee.jpg" alt="Bloody mary img" width="270" height="338">
    <p>This method mimics the traditional time-consuming method of making cold-brew coffee in the fridge, but in 2 hours
        instead of 24! The warm water temperature is kept low enough to speed up the cold-brew process, but not hot
        enough to release the bitter, acidic flavors you get from hot-brewed drip coffee. The result is a super smooth
        brew that you'll want to make again and again. Use your favorite fresh-ground coffee for best results.
    </p>
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup coarsely ground coffee</li>
        <li>4 (16-ounce) Mason jars</li>
        <li>8 cups water</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Step - 1: <p>Place 1/4 cup coffee grounds into each jar, then top with water. Screw on the lids until just
                barely tightened; do not overtighten.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step - 2: <p>Fill a large pot with enough water to cover the jars completely and place a sous vide immersion
                cooker into the water. Set temperature to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C) according to manufacturer's
                directions.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step - 3: <p>Submerge mason jars into the water bath and set timer for 2 hours.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step - 4: <p>Remove jars to a cooling rack and let cool until easily handled. Strain the mixture through a
                coffee filter to stop the steeping process. Pour over ice and serve, or return to rinsed-out jars and
                store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
